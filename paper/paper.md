# Statement of Need

The increasing complexity of energy systems necessitates advanced modeling tools to support decision-making in infrastructure planning and capacity expansion. This complexity is being driven by the need to ensure the reliability of renewable and storage-heavy grids, increased coupling and electrification of energy sectors, greater diversity in the technologies and policies being deployed, and many other factors. MacroEnergy.jl addresses this need by providing a flexible and extensible framework for simulating multi-sector energy systems, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore a wide range of scenarios and policy options.
